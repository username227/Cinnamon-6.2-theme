# Cinnamon-6.2-theme

These are the theme files that were bundled with Cinnamon 6.2.9. To use this as a theme for Cinnamon, simply install the cinnamon-6.2 folder to
<code>/usr/share/themes</code>
or
<code>/home/<i>username</i>/.local/share/themes</code>

If you are on Arch or an Arch-derivative, you can also download the package from releases, or install from the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cinnamon-6.2-theme).

Then, you can apply the theme from within Cinnamon by opening up Themes from Settings.
